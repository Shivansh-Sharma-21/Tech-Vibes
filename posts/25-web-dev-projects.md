One thing is always true, regardless of how long you've been in web development or how much you detest CSS bugs: you learn best by doing.

And let's face it, simply following instructions is insufficient. You must get your hands filthy, confront insects, scream into space, and emerge stronger.

Here is a carefully curated selection of web development project ideas, ranging from easy beginner projects to full-stack, portfolio-worthy monsters.

* **Deploy it**. Use Vercel, Netlify, or Firebase. A GitHub repo alone isn‚Äôt enough.


* **Add features in layers**. Build the MVP first, then iterate.

## üèÅ Final Thoughts: Build, Break, Repeat
Avoid becoming mired in instructional hell. Choose a project, work hard on it, break it, fix it, and then release it.

You learn something new from every project. Additionally, all "ugly" apps improve with time. Continue to construct. Continue to show up.

Furthermore, that portfolio won't develop on its own.
