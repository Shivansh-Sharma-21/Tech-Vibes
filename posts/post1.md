Next.js is a powerful React framework that enables server-side rendering and static site generation. Whether you want to build a blog, a landing page, or a full-stack app, Next.js has you covered.

## ðŸš€ Why Choose Next.js?

Here are a few reasons why developers love Next.js:

- **File-based Routing**: Easy routing by simply creating files in the `pages` or `app` directory.
- **SEO Friendly**: With SSR (Server-side Rendering) and SSG (Static Site Generation), your site can be optimized for search engines out of the box.
- **Performance**: Automatic code splitting, image optimization, and more.
- **Developer Experience**: Built-in TypeScript support, fast refresh, and easy deployment.

## ðŸ“¦ Installing Next.js

To get started, you just need to run the following:

```bash
