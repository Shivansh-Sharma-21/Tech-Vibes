# Introduction

This is a test post created to verify that the table of contents and related posts features are working correctly in our blog.

## Why This Test Post Exists

This post has been specifically crafted to have several headings of different levels, which should generate a proper table of contents. It also has a specific category to test related posts functionality.

### A Third-Level Heading

This is content under a third-level heading. The table of contents should show this with proper indentation.

## Testing Markdown Features

Let's test some markdown features to make sure our styling works correctly:

- **Bold text** for emphasis
- *Italic text* for subtle emphasis
- `Code snippets` for technical content

### Code Blocks

Here's a code block example:

```javascript
function testFunction() {
  console.log("Hello, world!");
  return true;
}
```

## Another Second-Level Heading

This is more content under another second-level heading. The table of contents should track all these headings.

### More Third-Level Content

And yet more content under a third-level heading for completeness of testing.

## Final Section

This is the final section of our test post. It should all be nicely formatted and the table of contents should work perfectly.
