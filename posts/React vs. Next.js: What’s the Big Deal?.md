React vs. Next.js: What’s the Big Deal?
Hey!! I think you are getting some trouble in choosing between the two of the most popular Javascript Frameworks- Next JS and React. Both are extensively used in the industry, But what is better?? Lets skim through the pros and cons of both and then we will compare and find the perfect fit for us!!

I love web development personally. React was generally considered the king of all the frameworks because it had may features like reusable components, react router, etc. It was and is a powerful tool to make our life easier as a developer.

And then enters Next JS, which actually gives you both frontend and backend development experience. Next JS complimented React with some additional features like server-side rendering (SSR), static site generation (SSG), API routes, and so much more. Great for SEO and speed of an website. It actually gave wings to the developers.

Lets dive deep into this!!

## What Makes React So Awesome?

React is like the most powerful weapon for a developer. My favourite is reusable component support. Now I don’t have to code the whole navbar again and again in all the files!! React gave a lot of freedom to the developers and it is still one of the most used frameworks for JavaScript.

Here’s why React is still a top choice for so many developers:

### Component-Based Architecture
You can build different components and con use it anywhere in you project. This is super time saver. As some of the components like Navbar/Header, Footer, Buttons, Cards, etc. are used repetitively on the sites. Reusable components makes it super easy to work.
### Virtual DOM
If you are familiar with Vanilla JS, you know that updating DOM manually was a Headache!! But React helps you with its Virtual DOM which handles everything for you behind the scenes. This makes development fast, efficient and less painful!
### Massive Community Support
You will never feel stuck while working with React because of its life-saver community support. You have question?? Someone already asked it three years ago on Stack Overflow. There is a solution for nearly everything in React, You just have to search for it!!
All these features makes React a very attractive option for developers, But now let us see what Next JS provides us with.

## What Makes Next.js Shine?

Ok so now lets view some features of Next JS which makes it compliment all the React features with a magic sprinkled on it. Next.js takes React to the next level. It adds features that make building modern web apps so much easier. Here’s what I love about it:

### Server-Side Rendering (SSR)
Ever suffered because of a slow site??? That’s because everything is rendered as a client component there. This is where Next JS enters. In Next JS, everything is a server component by-default, that means a very fast loading speed of the site which enhances the user experience.
### Static Site Generation (SSG)
This is the secret weapon of Next JS. It actually generates static HTML pages in the build time which ensures faster loading speed. This feature is great for blogs, portfolios, etc. where the content doesn’t change every second!
### File-Based Routing
Routing is the only thing which makes React painful. Next JS has a solution. Just create a file in the pages folder and boom!! You have added a new page in your site.
### API Routes
This one’s a game-changer. With Next.js, you can create API endpoints directly in your app. No need for a separate backend. It’s all in one place, and it just works.
### Automatic Code Splitting
This feature helps Next JS to load only the things which are needed on the page. No unnecessary things get loaded, which makes the site faster.
### Built-In CSS and Sass Support
Next.js makes styling easy, whether you’re using plain CSS, Sass, or a CSS-in-JS library like Emotion or Styled Components.

## When Should You Use React?
Look, React is still amazing. If your project doesn’t need all the fancy features of Next.js, React might be the better choice. Here are a few examples where React shines:

### Highly Customized Apps:
In react, you actually get the freedom to do anything with you app. It doesn’t judge you, feel free to customize your project as you wish.

### Lightweight Projects:
React is very minimal, that is great for simple apps or prototypes. Why to use Next JS for simple apps when you can build them way faster with react.

### Client-Side Rendering Only:
If you don’t bother about SEO and you app is heavily client-side, React can get you work done without the extra features which Next JS provides.

<br>

## When Should You Use Next.js?
Next JS provides you with all the powers of React plus some extra features. It’s especially great for:

### SEO-Heavy Websites:
Building a blog, e-commerce platform, or any site which actually care about their SEO, then Next JS’s SSR and SSG features are yours.

### Performance-Centric Apps:
Next JS makes you app lightning fast with its pre-rendering and code splitting features, hence enhancing overall user experience.

### Scalable Applications:
Next.js is perfect for apps that need to grow over time with its built-in routing, API endpoints, and server-side capabilities.

## React vs. Next.js: My Two Cents

If you are still confused on what to use – React or Next JS, my answer will be – it depends. React is actually like a blank canvas where you can paint anything you want, but you have to mix the colors and buy the brushes yourself. Next JS on the other hand, is like a paint toolkit which save your effort and time.

This is what I usually do:

* For simple projects where speed and simplicity are key, I stick with React.

* For anything more complex—especially if SEO or performance are priorities—I go with Next.js.
We just can’t say that one is better than the other. Both compliments each other’s beauty.

## Final Thoughts
Whether you choose React or Next JS, it doesn’t matter alot honestly. If you are still confused, start with React because Next JS can be added any time into the React project. Now by reading this blog you already know the key features and usecases of both technologies. Don’t take stress and have fun coding !!
